Week 4 Data Analytics
Overview: The purpose of this election audit analysis is to see which county in the election had the highest turnout, which nominee won, and what the winning vote count was. 
The election committee wanted us to complete these tasks to complete the audit and to save the command line to a .txt file.

Election-Audit Summary: This script may be used for any election where you need to find the number of voters and the percentage breakdown of votes in each county and for each candidate. 
This code would have to be modified for each proceeding election by if the data is not partitioned into three separate columns, we would have to clean up the data in excel in order to have 
the proper rows and columns linked to the code. This code would also have to be modified if the data was not in a .csv file so the upload may be different on a .txt file. 
If the data was in a .txt file we would have to modify the data so it could be in a .csv file.
