# School_District_Analysis
Overview: The purpose of this analysis is to show evidence of academic dishonesty at Thomas High School where the ninth graders reading, and math scores were altered. Maria and I had to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs, while keeping the rest of the data intact. We then had to repeat the school district analysis in the module.
	
Results:
•	The district summary is affected only in Thomas High School, where the 9th graders reading, and math scores are omitted.
•	The school summary is not affected aside from Thomas High School where the 9th graders at the high schools reading, and math scores are omitted. This omits 461 values as 461 of the values were ninth graders at THS high school.
•	Replacing the ninth graders math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to other schools actually help the passing scores for math and reading at Thomas High School. The percentage of students who passed math and reading in the rest of the data (10th-12th graders at THS) was about 90%. While the percent of students who passed both reading and math when the 9th graders are included was about 65%.
•	Replacing ninth graders affects the following:
o	Math and reading scores from on average 83 with the 9th graders to on average the same with the 10th through 12th graders.
o	Score by school spending from having a bad score for how much the school spends to a middle of the road spending ($638.00 per student) and having good scores.
o	Score by school size where THS is a medium sized school and scores increased drastically.
o	Score by school type where District schools performed worse than Charter Schools.

Summary:
•	After the math and reading scores have been replaced it changed the math and reading scores of THS High school by increasing the average score of each by student. 
This also affected score by school spending where the lower spenders had much better scores than the higher spenders. 
It should be noted smaller and medium schools performed better than the larger schools. Lastly Charter schools performed better than district schools
